# Student Grade Generator Toy Problem

The first challenge in this week's code challenge involves the formulation of a solution for the student grade generator problem. The challenge requires the student to come up with a solution that would prompt a given user to input marks and get subsequent grades.
My initial approach was to declare the function name for the sequence Iwas to code. I named the function,studentsMarksToGrade. 
I used a let principle to create a prompt that would allow the user to input different marks and I also indicated that the marks element will be represented by numbers.
I used the if and else conditiional operators to confine the prompts to digits limited between 0 and 100 and used console.log to show a string message if their inputs do not meet the valid criteria.
Once this was done,I added various if statements that would help the user access the required grade upon inputing their marks.
I ended the code with a return element to indicate that grade is the expected return of the function
