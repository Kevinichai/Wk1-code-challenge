# Student Grade Generator Toy Problem

The first challenge in this week's code challenge involves the formulation of a solution for the student grade generator problem. The challenge requires the student to come up with a solution that would prompt a given user to input marks and get subsequent grades.
My initial approach was to declare the function name for the sequence Iwas to code. I named the function,studentsMarksToGrade. 
I used a let principle to create a prompt that would allow the user to input different marks and I also indicated that the marks element will be represented by numbers.
I used the if and else conditiional operators to confine the prompts to digits limited between 0 and 100 and used console.log to show a string message if their inputs do not meet the valid criteria.
Once this was done,I added various if statements that would help the user access the required grade upon inputing their marks.
I ended the code with a return element to indicate that grade is the expected return of the function

# Speed Detector Toy Problem
The second challenge involved the creation of a speed detector program that would allow the user to be able to tell cars taht exceed the speedlimit and penalize them accordingly. I declared my function as overspeeding regulator to ensure that the intention of the function is well addressed. I then proceeded to confine the speed element to numerical quantification as the speed is measured arithmetically. I then used the const function to confine the various parameters used to define my code to subsequent numerical values that are not interchangeable.I then proceeded to use the if and else conditional operators to dictate the counter result outputed by content inputed into the program.
The program is ideal to be run on any available web browsers or online code editors.

# Net Salary Calculator Problem
The third challenge required the student to create a program that would help the user deduce their net salary. A net salary can be defined as the subsequent income derived from subtracting deductions such as PAYE,NSSF,NHIF,among others, from a persons gross income.Through the function element one can be able to create a program that is ideal to run on various web browsers and online code editors that can help the user do the task at hand.
By using the let keyword,the code editor is able to code in a prompt that acts as a call to action prompting the user to input their basic salary as well as their benefits. The program uses a const keyword to dictate that the grosssalary is a sum of both this inputs.
Using the grosssalary the program is able to calculate various deductions that are substracted from the gross salary in order for the user to get their net salary.
