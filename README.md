# SDF-FT10AP1 Hybrid Phase 1 Code Challenge-Toy Problems

# Learning Goals/Outcomes
How to use javascript to create viable programs to solve particular problems.

# Requirements
For this project I am required to use a javascript environment to solve 3 predetermined code related problems.

# Description
The project required an individual to solve 3 code problems collectively refered to as 'toy problems.These problems are described in further detail below:

Student Grade Generator Toy Problem

This was first challenge in this week's code challenge and it involves the formulation of a solution for the student grade generator problem. The challenge requires the student to come up with a solution that would prompt a given user to input marks and get subsequent grades.

Speed Detector Toy Problem

The second challenge involved the creation of a speed detector program that would allow the user to be able to tell cars that exceed the speedlimit and penalize them accordingly.

Net Salary Calculator Problem

The third challenge required the student to create a program that would help the user deduce their net salary. A net salary can be defined as the subsequent income derived from subtracting deductions such as PAYE,NSSF,NHIF,among others, from a persons gross income.

# Pre-Requisites.
For one to be able to run this code they would need to have the following requirements:
*A machine that runs on Windows 7+,Linux or Mac OS.
*Nodejs 10.0+
*An valid web browser with a developer console(usually accessed by pressing F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I in your browser) whereby you can paste the code intended to run.
*A valid code editor such as VS Code or an online code editor such as Codepen

# Installation
In order to be able to access this repository,there are a variety of steps one can take.

Alternative One

*Open a terminal / command line interface on your local machine(computer)

*Clone the repository holding this project by using the input:
 git clone https://github.com/Kevinichai/Wk1-code-challenge.git

*Wait for the sequence to run until it successfully clones the repository on your local machine

*Navigate to the repo folder using the cd function

*Open the repository on an editor of your choice(preferably Visual Studio Code)

*You have successfully cloned this repo and can now navigate its contents

Alternative Two
*Make your way to the repository main page and press the fork button

*This allows you to fork the repo to your individual github account from where you can use the first alternative to successfuly install this repo.

# Running the Programs
In order for one to successfully run these programs, a recent version of node.js is required.
If the application is not installed use the command nvm install followed by the version required for use.So as to ensure that the version used is the one installed run the command,nvm use followed by the version of node installed.
So as to avoid blockers and issues kindly use node from version 10 onwards.To check what node version is in use on your machine, run the command node-v on your terminal or command line interface.
Alternatively,the programs can be run on a web browser's developer console(for example,Chrome and Mozilla Firefox)
